Persival - persisten key value store in Go
==========================================

Persival is an in-memory pseudo key-value storage, very efficient to
keep list of records with small amount of data, when there's no need
of searching for the values nor keys.

Philosophy
----------
Persival follows those simple rules:

* No user-defined keys are allowed, system MUST decide under what key the
  value will be stored.
* All the data SHALL always be kept in the memory.
* Persistency SHALL be provided only via logging.
* Activity log SHOULD be merged after it reaches certain size.
* Search for the values CAN NOT be performed.

Storage implementation
----------------------
So far it's only proof of concept, so all the data is stored as a gob
encoded stream.

Installation
------------
Use the `go install` tool:

    $ go install github.com/nu7hatch/persival

Usage
-----

    package main
    
    import "github.com/nu7hatch/persival"
    
    func main() {
        bucket, _ := persival.NewBucket("./mybucket.bkt", 0)
        k1, _ := bucket.Set("hello")
        k2, _ := bucket.Set("world")
        bucket.Update(k2, "hurra")
        bucket.Delete(k1)
        bucket.Close()
    }
